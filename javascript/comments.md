## Comments
There are two types of comments in JavaScript: one line comments and block comments. 

* One line comments start with two forward slash characters
* Multi-line comments start with a forward slash and asterisk and end with an asterisk and forward slash. 

```js
// This comment occupies a line of its own
alert('Hello');

/* An example with two messages.
This is a multiline comment.
*/

alert('World');

```
