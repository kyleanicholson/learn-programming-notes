Variables are 'named storage' for data. Variables can be initialized and assigned values, which may or may not change over time. 

The statement below declares a variable with the name "message":
```javascript
let message;
```

Now we can put some data into the variable using the assignment operator `=`
```javascript
let message;
message = 'Hello'; // store the string 'Hello' in the variable named message
```

This string is saved into the memory area associated with the variable and can be accessed using the variable name.

```javascript
alert(message); // shows the variable content
```
