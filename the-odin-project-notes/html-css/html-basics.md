**HTML** (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a language that determines how documents and web pages are displayed in a web browser, the language for the building blocks of any website.
- Forms the basic structure of a website
- Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags
	- HTML elements are containers for content - opening and closing tags tell the browser what content the element contains.
		- The browser can then use that information to determine how it should interpret and format the content.

<opening tag> [Content] <closing tag>
