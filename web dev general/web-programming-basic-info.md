## The Web 

The World Wide Web, often referred to as the "Web," is a vast system of interconnected documents and resources that are accessible over the internet. It is one of the most significant developments in the history of computing and has transformed the way people access and share information, communicate, and conduct business. 

The Web has evolved over time, with advancements such as Web 2.0, which introduced user-generated content and interactive web applications, and the growing importance of web security and mobile web access. It continues to shape the way people interact with information and technology in the digital age.

### What is the internet?  

The **internet** is like a vast global network of computers and devices that are all connected together. It's the foundation of the web and allows information and data to travel between these devices. As a web developer, you'll use the internet to share websites and apps with people worldwide. Think of it as the "highway" for your web content, connecting your work to billions of potential users, making it accessible from anywhere with an internet connection.
### What are web pages? 

**Web pages** are digital documents displayed in web browsers when you access a website. They contain various types of content, including:

1. **Text:** Information, articles, and written content.
2. **Images:** Pictures, graphics, and photographs.
3. **Hyperlinks (Links):** Clickable elements that connect one web page to another.
4. **Videos:** Multimedia content for playback.
5. **Forms:** Input fields for user interaction (e.g., search boxes, login forms).
6. **Interactive Elements:** Buttons, menus, and scripts that enable user actions.

When you visit a website, your web browser requests and displays these web pages, allowing you to navigate the internet and access information.

### What is the difference between a web page and a website?

The terms "web page" and "web site" are often used interchangeably, but they actually refer to different things:

**Web Page**: A web page is a single document on the internet. It's what you see on your screen when you follow a specific link or URL. Each web page is identified by a unique URL and can contain text, images, videos, and other multimedia elements. It's akin to a single page in a book. For example, a news article or a contact information page is a web page.
    
**Web Site**: A website is a collection of related web pages that are connected under one domain name. Think of a website as a book, and each web page is a page within that book. A website typically has a homepage, which is the main or introductory page, and then it branches out to multiple other pages like 'About Us', 'Contact', 'Blog', etc. For example, a news portal with various articles, an about section, and contact information forms a website.

### What are web browsers?
**Web browsers** are software applications that allow you to access and view web pages on the internet. They are the primary tools for interacting with the World Wide Web. 
### What are Servers? 
**Servers** are powerful computers or software systems that store, manage, and deliver data, services, or resources to other computers or devices over a network, such as the internet. Servers play a fundamental role in the functioning of the internet and various networked systems. They store and deliver web content, process transactions, host applications, and enable communication between devices across the globe.
### What is a URL?
A **URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) is like a web address that tells your web browser exactly where to find a specific resource, like a web page or a file, on the internet. It typically consists of several parts: the protocol (e.g., "http://" or "https://"), the domain name (like "[www.example.com](http://www.example.com)"), and a path (the specific location of the resource on the server). URLs are what you type in your browser's address bar to access websites, and they are essential for linking to and finding content on the web.

### What are IP addresses?

IP addresses are like the street addresses of the internet, given to every device connected to a network. They are unique numbers that help in identifying each device and making sure information goes to the right place.

There are two types of IP addresses:

1. **IPv4**: This is the most common type. It looks like a set of four numbers separated by dots, like 192.158.1.38. Each number can be anything from 0 to 255. However, because there are so many devices online, we're running out of these IPv4 addresses.

2. **IPv6**: This newer type was created to solve the problem of running out of IPv4 addresses. IPv6 addresses are much longer, using a mix of numbers and letters, and look something like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334. This format allows for a huge number of unique addresses.

Each time you connect a device, like your smartphone or computer, to the internet, it gets an IP address. This address is what allows the device to send and receive information over the internet, making sure all the data you request goes to your device and not somewhere else. IP addresses are essential for devices to communicate over the internet.
### What are Domain Names?
Domain names are the human-readable addresses of websites on the internet, offering a simpler alternative to numerical IP addresses. Each domain name consists of a unique label (like 'google' in 'google.com') and a top-level domain (TLD) such as .com, .org, .net, or country-specific endings like .uk or .us. They function as identifiers: when you enter a domain name in a browser, the Domain Name System (DNS) translates it into the corresponding server's IP address, allowing the browser to retrieve the website's content. Domain names must be registered through a domain registrar for a certain period and are crucial for branding, making websites easily identifiable and memorable. Their uniqueness means once a domain name is registered, it can't be used by anyone else until the registration expires and is not renewed.


## Web Programming 
### What is programming?

Programming is the art of creating instructions for computers to perform specific tasks, done by writing code in various languages like Python, JavaScript, or Java. At its core, programming involves understanding the problem you want to solve, then planning how to tackle it. This planning stage is crucial as it determines the structure and flow of your code.

The actual process of programming is more than just typing out code; it's about translating your ideas and solutions into a language the computer understands. After writing the code, the next important steps are testing and debugging. This is where you make sure your program works as intended and fix any errors, known as bugs. Over time, you'll also update and maintain your program to add new features or improve performance.

As a beginner in web development, understanding that programming is a combination of problem-solving, logical thinking, and creativity will help you grasp its essence. It's not just about writing code, but about bringing ideas to life and continuously refining them. Programming is a foundational skill in web development, enabling you to build and enhance websites and applications.

### What is a program?

A program, in the context of computing, is a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer how to perform a specific task or set of tasks. These instructions are written by programmers or developers and can range from something as simple as a program that adds two numbers, to complex software like a web browser, a game, or an operating system. When you write a program, you're essentially creating a recipe for the computer to follow. Each step in the program tells the computer to do something, like take some input, process it, and then produce an output.

Programs can be as varied as the tasks they are designed to perform. Some might handle calculations, others manage the way information is stored, and some help users interact with a computer or another device. Programs are what make computers useful, allowing them to not just perform generic calculations, but also carry out complex tasks like browsing the internet, editing photos, managing business operations, or even controlling robots.

Here is an example a very simple program written using Python:

```python
# This program adds two numbers provided by the user

# Taking input from the user
number1 = input("Enter first number: ")
number2 = input("Enter second number: ")

# Converting the input from string to integer
number1 = int(number1)
number2 = int(number2)

# Adding the numbers
sum = number1 + number2

# Displaying the sum
print("The sum of", number1, "and", number2, "is", sum)

```


### What is a programming language?

A programming language is a formalized means of instructing a computer or machine to perform specific tasks or computations. It serves as a medium for humans to communicate with computers, giving them instructions in a way that computers can understand and execute. Programming languages vary widely in terms of their design, purpose, and application domains. The choice of a programming language depends on the specific task or project requirements, as well as personal preference and the community and ecosystem around the language.
### What are the Web Programming Languages? 

Websites and web applications are developed with a wide range of programming languages, some of which are more complex than others. Some of the most common web development languages today are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Go, and SQL. Each of these languages serves a different purpose and can be useful in the right context. Some of this list are are not, in fact, considered programming languages at all, for example, HTML does not have logical operators and is technically a markup language. 

###  Common Programming Languages in Web Development and their Use

## Why are there so many different languages?

 The main reason why there are so many different programming languages in web development is that all languages have specific use cases in which they excel -- in other words, they are well suited to certain types of tasks or some unique aspect of a project. Many websites, and especially web applications, incorporate multiple different programming languages, each of which handles the tasks that they are best suited for.
 
 A basic modern website uses HTML and CSS for structuring and styling content and JavaScript to manage the site's behavior and user interactions. You can accomplish a lot using only those three languages. It's possible to build entire applications with them, but eventually an application might become so complex or used on a large enough scale that it will become reasonable to consider modifying parts of the application or adding additional 'layers' which are built using other programming languages. Languages such as Go and Rust have become increasingly popular as faster or more 'performant' alternatives for specific tasks. These languages excel in scenarios where speed, efficiency, and security are important.
