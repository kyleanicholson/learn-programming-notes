## Introduction

- Data Structure: Arrangement of collection of data items so that operations on that data can be done efficiently.
- Where do data structures live? 
	- Main memory (RAM)
- When a program (stored on HD) is run, it is brought into main memory. Then the CPU executes that program. 
- Data is also brought into the main memory (for example a MS Word document) -- cannot be processed when in the hard drive.
- Applications can use data structures for arranging their data.
