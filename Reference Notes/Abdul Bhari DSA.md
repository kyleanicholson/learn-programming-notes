## 39. Introduction

- **Data Structure**: Arrangement of collection of data items so that operations on that data can be done efficiently.
- Where do data structures live? 
	- Main memory (RAM)
	- Applications can use data structures for arranging their data.
- When a program (stored on HD) is run, it is brought into main memory. Then the CPU executes that program. 
- Data is also brought into the main memory (for example a MS Word document) -- cannot be processed when in the hard drive.
- **Database**: Storage for large amounts of data that is organized in tables (often relational tables) on the hard drive. 
	- Application programs access the database, which is then pulled
