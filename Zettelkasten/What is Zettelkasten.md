# What is Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten is a personal tool for thinking and writing which makes a web of thought possible. The structure of information emerges as a result of the relationships between thoughts and ideas, as opposed to setting the structure first and 'organizing' thoughts and ideas into buckets.
