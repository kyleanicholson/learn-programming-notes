# Paths and Circuits

- A **path** is like a walk through a graph - it's okay to repeat vertices and edges as long as vertices are adjacent. 
- A **circuit** is a path that begins and ends at the same node with length 3+.  Circuits can contain repeated nodes, but never repeated edges
- **Simple paths** do not repeat edges, but can repeat a vertex
- Single vertex is a path of length 0, but not a circuit.
