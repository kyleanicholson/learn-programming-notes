- Graph problem-- bridges represent edges, and land masses represent vertices.
- Euler proved that the problem has no solution: If every bridge has been traversed exactly once, for each land mass, the number of bridges touching the land mass must be even. All four land masses in the original problem are touched by an odd number of bridges.
