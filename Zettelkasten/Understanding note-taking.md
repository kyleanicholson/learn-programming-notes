# Zettelkasten in Obsidian

If you are reading a book and discover an interesting idea, create a note, apply the Zettel template (Ctrl+Alt+T)

Explain the idea in your own words. 

Under references, write down where this idea came from.

If working with a source that could contain a large number of ideas, create a separate note dedicated for that source, inside the Reference notes folder. You can then *link* to that source. Double square brackets allow you to link to that note.

Tags allow you to create a link to a note, even one that doesn't exist. Obsidian will remember this, so you can link multiple notes together in the graph view.

Review the graph tab with Ctrl+G to see interlinking.

Adding nodes will eventually cause a structure to emerge - notes will be clustered around a 'hub' (tag).

These hubs can be converted to a MOC -- Map of Content. When atomic idea notes cluster around something, use the MOC template (Ctrl+Alt+T) to create.
