# C++ Constructor
When initializing an object of a given class in C++, you can use a constructor function to specify certain variables at the time the object is created. This is only possible if the class has a constructor function.

```c++
class Rectangle {
private:
	int length;
	int breadth;
public:
	Rectangle(int l, int 
}
```
