# Graph Isomorphisms 

- Two graphs are *isomorphic* provided we can relabel the vertices of one of the graphs using the labels of the other graph in such a way that the two graphs will have exactly the same edges.
- For two graphs to be isomorphic, they must have the same number of vertices, the same number of edges, and the same degree sequences .
- Yet, even if two graphs have the same number of vertices and the same number of edges, and degree sequence (list of degrees, in order), they may not be isomorphic. Need to verify with trial and error.
