# Graph Isomorphisms 

- Two graphs are *isomorphic* provided we can relabel the vertices of one of the graphs using the labels of the other graph in such a way that the two graphs will have exactly the same edges.
- For two graphs have a chance of being isomorphic, the two graphs must have the same number of vertices and the same number of edges. But warning: even if two graphs have the same number of vertices and the same number of edges, they need not be isomorphic. F
